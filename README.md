What is Required of My Program?
You have a lot of freedom to design any project you like for the Create Task. The task directions include only a few requirements for what you include as your program. This page summarizes those requirements, highlights the "takeaways." 
Input / Output Requirements
The video of your program requires you to demonstrate input and output in your program. 
Takeaway 1: Make sure your program has both input and output.
List Requirements
You'll need to create a list somewhere in your program, and later you'll want to access the information stored in that list. This list could be a hard-coded list, filled in by user input.
Takeaway 2: Make sure your program creates and uses a list of information.
Function Requirements
Your function needs to include "at least one procedure that uses one or more parameters to accomplish the programâ€™s intended purpose, and that implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration." Sequencing merely means that there are multiple lines of code that run in order. Selection means that a conditional, or if-statement, selects between two or more portions of your program to run. Iteration simply means repeating some behavior, as in a loop.
Takeaway 3: Make sure your program includes a function that has a parameter, an if-statement, and a loop.
Acknowledgment Requirements
The task directions ask that you "Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the submitted program code that has been written by someone other than you and/or your collaborative partner(s)." In theory, you could continue working on a project you started earlier in the year, or you could use code that you found elsewhere. You'll need to be extremely careful in each case that you indicate what is yours and only respond to questions based on the new code you or your partner wrote. You also need to cite any images or sounds that you didn't create.
Takeaway 4: Use comments to cite any code, images, sounds, etc. that you or your partner did not create yourselves during the task.
